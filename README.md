## Project Overview
<p align="justify">
  This project delves into the historical behavior of Tesla's stock prices utilizing time series analysis. 
  By analyzing historical data (open, high, low, close, volume), the project aims to identify trends, seasonality, and potential drivers influencing price movements. 
  Informative visualizations will be created to effectively communicate the findings. This project seeks to contribute valuable insights for investors and financial analysts regarding 
  Tesla's stock performance, promoting a deeper understanding of its historical and potential future behavior.
